What I Did:

Set up a local PostgreSQL database using Docker.
Created a seed.sql file for database structure and initial data.
Wrote a seed.js script to execute SQL commands programmatically using Node.js and pg.
Configured the API to connect to the local database through environment variables.
Issues Faced:

Connection Refused: The backend couldn't connect to the database due to timing issues during Docker startup.

Fixed by adding depends_on in docker-compose.yml to ensure the database starts before the backend.
SSL Error: The local PostgreSQL database didnâ€™t support SSL connections, while the code was configured to use SSL.

Resolved by disabling SSL for local connections in connection.js and using the NODE_ENV variable to toggle settings for production and development.
